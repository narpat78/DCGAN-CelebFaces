# DCGAN-CelebFaces
This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) from scratch using PyTorch to generate realistic human faces. The model is trained on the CelebA dataset and demonstrates the fundamental principles of adversarial training between a Generator and a Discriminator.
